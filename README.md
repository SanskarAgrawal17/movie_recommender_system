# Movie Recommender System

Our "Movie Recommender System" is an innovative application that harnesses the power of Machine Learning to provide personalized movie recommendations to users. Using the Bag of Words model, our system effectively analyzes textual data, extracting key features to understand user preferences. This model enables us to create a dynamic and responsive recommendation engine, continuously learning and adapting to user behavior.

To seamlessly connect the front end and back end of our application, we have employed the Flask framework. This lightweight and efficient web framework not only facilitates smooth communication between the user interface and the recommendation engine but also ensures a user-friendly and intuitive experience. With HTML and CSS, we've crafted an appealing and interactive front end, enhancing overall user engagement and satisfaction.

In essence, our Movie Recommender System is a holistic blend of cutting-edge technologies and frameworks, where Machine Learning, Bag of Words, Flask, HTML, CSS, and Pickle work in harmony to deliver a sophisticated and user-centric movie recommendation platform
